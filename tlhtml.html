					<td>Starting in or about the 1990s, Jose Hawilla agreed on behalf of Traffic International to pay AFA, the Argentinian soccer federation, millions of dollars per edition of the Copa America so that AFA would field its best players. At times, Hawilla was directed to send the payments not to AFA, but to a travel agency used to facilitate payments to Co-Conspirator #1 personally. Hawilla then sent the payments as directed. Hawilla also agreed to make payments to CBF, the Brazilian soccer federation, to ensure that CBF would field its best players for the Copa America editions played in or about and between 2001 to 2011. At times, the defendant RICARDO TEIXEIRA directed Hawilla to make the payments to accounts that were unknown to Hawilla, and that a Traffic financial officer informed Hawilla were not CBF accounts. </td>

					<td>Signing ceremony</td>
					<td>in Asuncion, Paraguay, Jose Hawilla signed the contract on behalf of Traffic, as did two CONMEBOL officials on behalf of the confederation. The defendant NICOLAS LEOZ, then the president of CONMEBOL, declined to sign the contract. In a private meeting, LEOZ told Hawilla, in sum and substance, that Hawilla would make a lot of money from the rights he was acquiring and LEOZ did not think it was fair that he (LEOZ) did not also make money. LEOZ told Hawilla that he would only sign the contract if Hawilla agreed to pay him a bribe. After Hawilla agreed to make the payment, LEOZ signed the contract. Hawilla caused the payment -    a six-figure U.S. dollar payment -to be made to an account designated by LEOZ</td>

					<td>In approximately 1993 or 1995, the defendant NICOLAS LEOZ began demanding additional bribe payments around the time each edition of the tournament was played. Jose Hawilla agreed to make these payments and caused them to be made. The defendant NICOLAS LEOZ solicited and received bribe payments from Hawilla in connection with every Copa America edition until 2011. The payments increased over time, and ultimately reached the seven figures. </td>

For example, Hawilla made periodic six-figure payments to the defendants EDUARDO DELUCA, EUGENIO FIGUEREDO, and ROMER OSUNA in connection with multiple editions of the tournament through in or about 2007, during which time DELUCA, FIGUEREDO, and OSUNA, were the general secretary, vice president, and treasurer of CONMEBOL, respectively.</td>

Over the course of the 2007 and 2011 editions of the tournament, held in Venezuela and Argentina, respectively, ESQUIVEL solicited and received bribe and kickback payments totaling in the seven figures from, variously, Jose Hawilla and another senior Traffic executive, Co-Conspirator #9. Hawilla agreed to make the bribe payments to ESQUIVEL, who at the time was the president of FVF, the Venezuelan soccer 6federation, and a member of the CONMEBOL executive committee, in exchange for ESQUIVEL's continued official support of Traffic's position as exclusive holder of the marketing rights to the Copa America and of Traffic's ability to commercialize the rights. </td>

After discussing the matter with Co-Conspirator #9, Hawilla agreed to the payment and caused it to be made, in part because he hoped to secure ESQUIVEL's official support for Traffic in a dispute between Traffic and Full Play (see CONMEBOL/CONCACAF Copa America Centenario Scheme, below) concerning which company would hold the commercial rights to the Copa America going forward.</td>

On or about July 22, 2011, at the direction of Traffic executives, approximately $1,000,000 was wired from an account held in the name of Co-Conspirator #10, an intermediary, at Banco Itau in Brazil, to an account held in the name of Co-Conspirator #10's investment company ("Investment Company A"), the identity of which is known to the Grand Jury, at Banco Itau in Miami, Florida. That same day, the funds were wired from the latter account to an account at UBS in Miami held in the name of an entity controlled by ESQUIVEL</td>
